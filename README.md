## Hi, I'm Ashutosh 👋

I am a Power Electronics and Embedded Systems engineer with industry R&D experience and a strong interest in simulation-driven design, system reliability, and hardware–software integration.

### Technical Interests
- Power electronics and converters
- Motor drives and control systems
- Embedded systems (STM32, ARM)
- MATLAB/Simulink and PSIM simulations

### Selected Projects
- BLDC Motor Fault Diagnosis (MATLAB/Simulink)
- Physics-Based Digital Twin of Buck Converter
- Ramp-Based SCR Firing Circuit using PSIM
- Embedded Systems and STM32 Hardware Interfacing

More project repositories will be added progressively.
